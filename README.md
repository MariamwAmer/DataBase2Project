# DataBase2Project

This project is a small database engine with support for Octrees Indices. 
Functionalities are 1) creating tables, 2) inserting tuples, 3) deleting tuples, 4) 
searching in tables linearly, 5) creating an Octree upon demand, and 6) using the created 
octree(s) where appropriate. 
Note that this is a simplified data base engine â€“ for example, it doesn't support 
foreign keys or referential integrity constraints.
